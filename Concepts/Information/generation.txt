Do generate the game the first concept starts of by having a list of numbers from
1 to 9 to make the first 9 numbers in the first row. After that there are two ways
right now of doing it that sounds easy and simple.

Version 1:
Generate the first row by shuffle and loop index from temp list with my numbers and
insert them on each button one by one. After the first row is done generate number by
number one by one and check if that number works and then go to the next botton and
do so until the gameboard is done.

Version 2:
Start the same way as version 1 in the beggning with the first row. After the first
row is done you make generate the entire next row and check all the parameters if
it's correct placement.

If NOT then generate a new enitire row of numbers and try that again. This can go
on forever but with computers by now beeing really powerful there should just be
a short time for it to find a correct row.

If YES then save each number onto the correct tkinter varible and save it into the
data base correct. After that is done you can go on and try do generate the next row.
