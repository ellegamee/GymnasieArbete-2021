Use a text tkinter varible.
If I do so I can link my database directly to each button.

tkinter set/get function
can get value and set a value

refer back to tk_varible.py where there are
snippets of code that will be inplemented into
the gameboard conecpts

They will be saved in the data base like:
StringVar(root, name="--undefined--")

How to get valus from the data base!
for i in gb["Rows"]["r1"]:
    print(i.get())
